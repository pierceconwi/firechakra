// FIRECHAKRA: TODO APP

This web application is designed to provide users with a personal organizer capable of tracking outstanding tasks, upcoming events, and personal contacts. It is built using React.js and Chakra UI for the front end, and uses Next.js and Firestore to handle the back end. The app features full CRUD support and was designed with a mobile-first responsive layout.

// NOTES

[_] Need to style nav so that the current page is indicated by changing the background color of the corresponding nav item.
[_] Need to make Phone and Email fields on contact forms strict regarding input format accepted.
[_] Need to constrain entire app on larger viewports (i.e. force the app into a smaller max width in the pursuit of better app consistency and learnability).
