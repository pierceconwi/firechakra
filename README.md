[_] Fix delete item functionality. Items should be deleting from the app upon clicking the gray trash can icon in the upper-right of each card listed on the Home screen. The button seems to be positioned behind the card and any click on the trash icon is read by the browser as a click on the parent card instead.
[_] Make item cards fully responsive across all pages
